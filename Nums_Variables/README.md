Remember, a variable is assigned a value with the equal (=) sign. 

It can be assigned a number:

Assign the **integer** 10 to a variable named **decade**.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
```python
_________ = 10
```
{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}

You should have the following:

```python
decade = 10
```

It can also be assigned a string, which are identified with **quotation marks**. 

Assign the ***string*** 10 to a variable named **decade_str**.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
Did you remember the quotation marks?
{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}
You should have the following:

```python
decade = 10
decade_str = '10'
```
We can assign the variable directly, or we can take input from the user.
