# Variables and Data Types

Start a new file and name it **nums_variables.py**.

Remember, a variable is assigned a value with the equal (=) sign. 

## Variable Assignment: Numbers
It can be assigned a number:

Assign the **integer** 10 to a variable named **decade**.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
```python
_________ = 10
```
{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}

You should have the following:
Note: The syntax highlighting (the colors) might not be the same.

```python
years = 10
```
## Variable Assignment: Strings
It can also be assigned a string, which are identified with **quotation marks**. 

Assign the ***string*** 10 to a variable named **decade_str**.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
Did you remember the quotation marks?
{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}
You should have the following:

```python
years = 10
years_str = '10'
```

### Changing the Value of a Variable

At any point in our code, we can change the value of a particular variable by simply reassigning it.

Change the value of *years* to the number 20. 

{% next %}
Your code should now look like this:

```python
years = 10
years_str = '10'
years = 20
```

Edit your code, as needed, so that it prints the value of each variable and it's data type (string, integer, or float).  

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
In order to print the datatype to the screen, you should type **print(type(*name_of_variable*))**.
{% endspoiler %}

## Variable Assignment: Input
We can assign the variable like we did above or we can take input from the user.

Type the following into your editor:
