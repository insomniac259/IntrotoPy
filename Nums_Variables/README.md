# Variables and Data Types

Remember, a variable is assigned a value with the equal (=) sign. It can be assigned a string or a number. 

Assign the **integer** 10 to a variable named **decade**

{% spoiler "Hint" %}
```
_________ = 10
```
{% endspoiler %}

You should have the following:

```
decade = 10
```

We can assign the variable directly, or we can take input from the user.
