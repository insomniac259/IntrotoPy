## Step 1
Please run the code titled 'errorfix1.py' and debug (correct any and all errors).

The output that you get should be:

```
I can't wait for this three day weekend!

woot! Math...

```

## Step 2
Once code is in proper working condition, place a **comment** above each line that explains what is happening in the line beneath it. Your comment should be clear and should let me know that you understand what is happening at each line of the program.

{% next %}

## Step 3
Once you are finished with your comments, copy and paste the working program into CS50 IDE and save it as **errorfix1.py**

{% next %}

## Step 4
Answer the question which I've included at the end of the program.





{% spoiler "Hints" %}
Some common errors are
spelling-------
improper variable name (does not follow the rules)---------------
inconsistent variable names (for example, capitalized in one line of the code, but not in another line...Word is NOT equal to word.)...
